    <p>Hi there! We are <a href='/about_us'>two rising juniors at Harvard University</a> offering one-on-one online tutoring for high school, middle school, and elementary school students. We tutor a variety of subjects from pre-algebra to calculus and English to computer science. In addition, we offer college preparatory services such as college essay advice and standardized test prep. To support learning pods and other group learning settings, we are available to teach workshops and seminars on pre-specified topics. We both have extensive past experience tutoring in the subjects below and are excited to help students reach their full potential.

    <span class='subject-header'>INDIVIDUAL: </span>We take students first-come, first-serve, and our pricing is worked out on a case-by-case basis. We generally will meet on Zoom but can try to accommodate other calling platforms. Tutoring sessions last from 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the studentâ€™s needs. 
  </p>
  <p> <span class='subject-header'>GROUP LEARNING: </span>For workshops and seminars, we will use the initial consultation to discuss logistics such as pricing, schedule, and syllabus with a group leader. We can accomodate both one-time and recurring seminar sessions.
