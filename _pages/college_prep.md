### Standardized Test Prep (SAT, ACT)

We offer tutoring for the SAT-I (Math, ERBW) and the ACT (English, Reading, Math, Science). For our own test scores and test prep tutoring experience, see <a href='/Onassis/about_us'>ABOUT US</a>. 

##### Recommended Guides

We recommend generally that students use <a href = 'https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/study-guide-students' target="_blank">The Official SAT Study Guide 2020</a> and <a href = 'https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/test-preparation/the-official-guide.html' target="_blank">The Official ACT Prep Guide 2020-2021</a> for SAT and ACT tutoring sessions, respectively. We can guarantee that we have access to only the official guides, but we are flexible and can try to work with what resources the student has along with or in lieu of these materials.

### College Essay Services

In addition to standardized test prep, we offer college essay consultations for all stages of the process, from brainstorming to final revisions. We understand that the college essay writing process is often challenging and highly individual and are excited to draw upon our own experiences and knowledge to better guide you through it.
