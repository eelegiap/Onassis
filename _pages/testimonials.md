<p>"I really appreciated what you have done on tutoring Judy's math. You are well prepared for each lesson and always on time. You always encourage your little student and make her feel confident at math, which she used to feel scared of. Very responsible too, emailed me the materials after each lesson, so I can have my daughter redo them as homework. 

She really learned a lot from you. She started Pre-algebra this semester, recently I heard the same words "I already know how to do it, Paige taught me." over and over again." <span class='testifier'>- Judy's mother</span></p>

<p>"Last year I had the pleasure of being taught by Alyssa in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. The course material was frequently challenging, but attending her sections helped me understand the concepts better. She used class time to walk through helpful examples that applied concepts from the main lecture and presented them clearly and patiently. For instance, she would pose a problem and allow me and other classmates to think for a few minutes, and if stuck, she would provide incremental hints that would put us on the right path but not give away too much. Overall, Alyssa is an excellent teacher!" <span class='testifier'>- Dylan, Harvard Student </span> </p>
