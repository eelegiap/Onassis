"Testing" *-Testing*

"Last year I had the pleasure of being taught by Alyssa in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. The course material was frequently challenging, but attending her sections helped me understand the concepts better. She used class time to walk through helpful examples that applied concepts from the main lecture and presented them clearly and patiently. For instance, she would pose a problem and allow me and other classmates to think for a few minutes, and if stuck, she would provide incremental hints that would put us on the right path but not give away too much. Overall, Alyssa is an excellent teacher!" *- Dylan, Harvard Student*
